# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains my exercises and practice code for learning and applying data structures in Python.  

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to build a collection of exercises and solutions related to data structures and common problems involving them.  
I will continuously add and push new exercises as I study and develop solutions to problems using data structures.  

This repository serves as:
- A personal reference for me to revisit when needed.
- A public space to showcase my learning journey in data structures with Python.

## Current content

At the moment, the repository includes:
- Sorting exercises (e.g., sorting VNL Men 2023 players by age).

## Whatâ€™s next

I plan to fill this repository with various exercises covering:
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash tables
- Graphs  
... and other data structures applied to different types of problems.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress!

## Language

All exercises are written in Python.
